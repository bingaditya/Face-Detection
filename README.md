# Face-Detection
The objective of our project is to design a system that can detect human faces from
an image..

Face detection is a computer technology that determines the
location and size of human faces in arbitrary(digital) image. It
detects facial features and ignores anything else such as building ,
trees and bodies etc..

In pre-processing, image is normalized and noises are removed.

The Classifier decides face and non face class based on information learned
during training.

Finally, output locate the face region.
